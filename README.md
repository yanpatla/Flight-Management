"# Flight-Management" 

This project is an assignment given to me by Kubiya Company. It is a Flight Manager in which we can see data about the flight status, flight number, when it takes off and when it arrives at destination, we can find the flight based on the flight number or the place of take off and destination.

Technologies used: React(VITE), TypeScript, Function Components, Emotion Styled Components, Mobx, Context and Socket.io.
